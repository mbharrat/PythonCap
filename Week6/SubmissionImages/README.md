Assignment Tasks:
	
	In this assignment you will visualize the mailing list data you have downloaded from http://mbox.dr-chuck.net/ and take some screen shots. Important: You do not have to download all of the data - it is completely acceptable to visualize a small subset of the data for this assignment.

	Don't take off points for little mistakes. If they seem to have done the assignment give them full credit. Feel free to make suggestions if there are small mistakes. Please keep your comments positive and useful. 

	1. Run the gbasic.py file to compute basic histogram data on the messages you have retrieved and take a screenshot of it

		File name: basic.png (first 10)

	2. A screen shot of word cloud visualization for the messages you have retrieved.

		File name: cloud.png

	3. A screen shot of time line visualization for the messages you have retrieved.

		File name: line.png

	4. Optional Challenge: Change the gline.py program to show the message count by month instead of by year and take a screen shot to the by month visualization. You can switch from a by-year to a by-month visualization by changing only a few lines in gline.js. The puzzle is to figure out the smallest change to accomplish the change. If you do not want to do this optional challenge - just upload the above image a second time.

		File name: month.png
