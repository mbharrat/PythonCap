# Assignment 5 (optional)

## Assignment Introduction:
	
The task for this week is to make a discussion forum post that reflects the progress you have made to date in perform the analysis of your data source. We hope that by now, you have successfully built a process to gather the data and clean the data as needed - whatever it takes to start the analysis of the data.

The final discussion forum post will be the actual analysis of the data. This post is about getting ready to analyze the data.

## Discussion Prompt:

What progress have you made in obtaining your data, cleaning it up, and beginning your analysis? Did you decide to use a different data source than the one you had identified in Week 3? What challenges have you encountered so far?

No actual coding has taken place as of yet, but a rough draw up has been made. The first step would be to correctly take the data in the Diamond.csv file and put it into a database (diamondr.sqlite). After that's completed, the user would need to be prompted for selections somehow. For example, a user could only be interested in a specific color diamond as well as size and price. Using these preferences, we can clean the data and create a "clean" databases (cdiamond.sqlite). Using this database, we can generate a json file or whatever file we need to, to visualize the data in whichever way we feel is appropriate. Planning should be completed by the middle of this week and this weekend will involve actual code to be developed. (4/25/17).
