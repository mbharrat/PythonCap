I examined the Diamonds.csv file. In this file, each diamond has attributes consisting of Carat, Color, Clarity, Depth, PricePerCt, as well as TotalPrice. This data caught my eye because I recently got engaged and personally, the ring shopping process was a little overwhelming. It took a few weeks before I was knowledgeable enough to make an educated purchase on a diamond. However, with this data I feel like you could produce and visualize some extremely helpful trends in diamonds that would aid even the most novice of diamond hunters. For example depending on the buyers preference, you would be able to find out just how big you could get a diamond without sacrificing quality for a given price point. With this data you could visualize very specific and tailored information to a consumer.
