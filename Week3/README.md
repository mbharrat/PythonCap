Assignment included:
	
	*many links to multiple databases

		I picked Diamonds.csv

Assignment Intro:

	In this week, we want you to identify a data source and make a short discussion forum post about it. We have provided a reading page with a great set of starting points to give you ideas about some data sources that might be interesting to you.

	Once you identify and evaluate your data source, we want you to make a short post in the Week 3 Discussion Forum describing the data source and outlining some possible analysis that could be done with the data source. You should direct the post to your fellow students as they might want to do a project using the data source you are presenting.

	Making a post is completely optional. If you do not want to make a post, you are still encouraged to review and comment on some of the posts by other students.

	In later weeks you will analyze and present your analysis of your data. We are happy for the analysis to be done by either an individual or a group.

	And even if you make a post on one data source - you are not bound to do a project on that data source. You may see a post from another student that piques your interest and you may choose to join their effort or just do some data analysis on your own using their data source. We want this optional discussion thread track to give you as much flexibility as you need to learn as much as possible from the work of your fellow students

Assignment Prompt:
	
	Which data sources did you examine, and how did you evaluate them? What prompted your choice? Is the subject useful to you professionally, or one that you have a personal interest in? What kind of analysis could be done with this data?
